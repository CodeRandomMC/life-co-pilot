## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical implementation of **Principle 5: The User Holds the Key** from the Life Co-Pilot Ethical Engineering Framework. The Encrypted Self-Reflection Journal ensures that user data remains private through client-side encryption, making **trust a mathematical guarantee** rather than a promise.

## Alignment with Ethical Framework

### Core Principles Integration

**Principle 1 (Supportive Mirror)**: The encryption system operates transparently, reflecting the user's agency and control over their own data.

**Principle 3 (Empowerment Through Transparency)**: Users understand exactly how their data is protected through clear educational elements and progressive disclosure.

**Principle 4 (User Sovereignty)**: Absolute user control over data access, with no server-side decryption capabilities.

**Principle 5 (The User Holds the Key)**: Mathematical guarantee of privacy through client-side encryption with user-controlled keys.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Browser Crypto Implementation

#### Core Encryption Stack

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Web Crypto API              │
│    • AES-GCM 256-bit encryption    │
│    • PBKDF2 key derivation         │
│    • Secure random generation      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│      Browser Security Model        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Technical Specifications

- **Encryption Algorithm**: AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with minimum 100,000 iterations
- **Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random values via `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- **Initialization Vectors**: Unique per encryption operation

### 2. Key Management System

#### Passphrase-Based Key Derivation

```javascript
// Conceptual implementation outline
async function deriveEncryptionKey(passphrase, salt) {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const keyMaterial = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    "raw",
    encoder.encode(passphrase),
    "PBKDF2",
    false,
    ["deriveBits", "deriveKey"]
  );

  return await crypto.subtle.deriveKey(
    {
      name: "PBKDF2",
      salt: salt,
      iterations: 100000, // Configurable based on device capability
      hash: "SHA-256",
    },
    keyMaterial,
    { name: "AES-GCM", length: 256 },
    false,
    ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
  );
}
```

#### Security Guarantees

- **Zero Server Knowledge**: Encryption keys never leave the browser
- **Memory-Only Storage**: Keys exist only during active sessions
- **No Persistence**: Keys are re-derived from passphrase each session
- **Salt Uniqueness**: Unique salt per user account prevents rainbow table attacks

### 3. Data Flow Architecture

#### Encryption Workflow

```
User Input → Encryption Layer → Encrypted Storage → Server
     ↑                                               ↓
User Passphrase ← Key Derivation ← Encrypted Data ← Response
```

#### Detailed Process Flow

1. **Data Creation**: User generates reflection content through AI interaction
2. **Pre-Encryption**: Content prepared for encryption with metadata
3. **Key Derivation**: Encryption key derived from user passphrase
4. **Encryption**: Content encrypted with AES-GCM using derived key
5. **Storage**: Encrypted payload sent to server (server cannot decrypt)
6. **Retrieval**: Encrypted data retrieved from server
7. **Decryption**: Client-side decryption using re-derived key
8. **Display**: Decrypted content presented to user

## Usability Design

### 1. Transparent UX Layer

#### Passphrase Management

- **Creation Flow**: Guided passphrase creation with real-time strength indicators
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear encryption status indicators throughout the interface
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Technical details available but not overwhelming

#### User Interface Elements

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔐 Your Journal is Encrypted       │
│  ────────────────────────────────   │
│  Status: ● Encrypted and Secure     │
│  Last Access: 2 hours ago           │

│  [📖 Open Journal] [⚙️ Settings]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Recovery and Backup Options

#### Recovery Phrase System

- **One-Time Display**: 12-word recovery phrase generated and displayed once
- **User Responsibility**: Clear warnings about permanent data loss if phrase is lost
- **Optional Feature**: Users can choose to enable or skip recovery phrase

#### Export Functionality

- **Encrypted Backup**: Full encrypted export of journal data
- **Portable Format**: JSON structure that can be imported later
- **Verification**: Integrity checks to ensure backup completeness

### 3. Educational Elements

#### Security Literacy

- **Encryption Explanation**: Simple analogy-based explanations of client-side encryption
- **Trust Model**: Clear explanation of zero-knowledge architecture
- **User Agency**: Emphasis on user control and responsibility

#### Progressive Disclosure Interface
